# _core-adr-008: XDR standards - structured

## Context and Problem Statement

Some XDR documents define multiple distinct policies or rules. When other documents, skills, or agents need to refer to one specific rule without copying its content, there is no standardized way to identify and cite it precisely. Prose references like "see the third bullet in Implementation Details" are fragile and ambiguous.

Question: How should an XDR document expose individually referenceable rules or policies when precise external citation is required?

## Decision Outcome

**Numbered rule blocks inside Implementation Details with a canonical citation syntax**

When an XDR document needs to expose individually referenceable rules, each rule must be placed inside `### Implementation Details` as a numbered heading block. Referencing documents and skills must cite rules using the canonical dot-notation identifier.

### Implementation Details

Use this format only when there is an explicit need for external documents, skills, or agents to reference specific items inside an XDR without duplicating the full policy text. Standard XDRs that do not require item-level citation should follow `_core-adr-002-xdr-standards` without adding numbered rule headings.

#### Rule block format

Each numbered rule must be written as:

```markdown
#### [NN]-[short-descriptive-title-in-kebab-case]
[Body using mandatory or advisory language as defined in _core-adr-001. State the requirement and the situations in which it must or should be followed. Under 500 words.]
```

Where `NN` is a two-digit zero-padded sequence number (e.g. `01`, `02`, `12`). Numbers must be unique within the document and must never be reused after a rule is removed.

Rule bodies must use the mandatory or advisory language terms defined in `_core-adr-001`:

- Mandatory: "must", "always", "never", "required", "mandatory"
- Advisory: "should", "recommended", "advised", "preferably", "possibly", "optionally"

#### Citation syntax

When another document or skill cites a specific rule, it must use the following dot-notation:

```
[xdr-name].[NN-short-descriptive-title-in-kebab-case]
```

Examples:

- `_core-adr-008-xdr-standards-structured.[01-use-numbered-rules-only-when-needed]`
- `_local-bdr-003-data-retention-policy.[02-purge-schedule-for-pii]`

The `xdr-name` must match the `name` field in the frontmatter of the source document exactly. The rule identifier after the dot must match the heading text exactly, including the two-digit prefix and kebab-case title.

#### 01-use-numbered-rules-only-when-needed

Numbered rule blocks must only be added to an XDR when there is an explicit and concrete need for other documents, skills, or agents to cite individual rules by identifier. Adding numbered rules speculatively or for organizational purposes only is not recommended. Standard XDR documents that are not expected to be cited at the rule level should follow `_core-adr-002-xdr-standards` without this structured format.

#### 02-rule-numbering-must-be-stable

Rule numbers must never be reused within the same document. When a rule is removed, its number becomes permanently retired for that document. Gaps in the sequence are expected and must not be filled by renumbering remaining rules, as existing citations depend on number stability.

#### 03-rule-body-must-use-normative-language

Every rule body must contain at least one mandatory or advisory language term as defined in `_core-adr-001`. Rule bodies without normative language must not be published, as they fail to communicate whether compliance is required or recommended.

#### 04-citations-must-use-exact-identifiers

Documents and skills that cite a rule must use the exact dot-notation form: `[xdr-name].[NN-short-descriptive-title-in-kebab-case]`. Prose paraphrases such as "see rule 3" or "the third rule in that XDR" must not be used as citations, because they are ambiguous and break when rules are reordered or reworded.

## Considered Options

* (REJECTED) **Free-form prose rules with section anchors** — Use markdown heading anchors as citation targets.
  * Reason: Anchors are fragile across editors, rendering tools, and refactors. They do not enforce a stable numbering contract and break silently when headings are reworded.
* (CHOSEN) **Numbered rule blocks inside Implementation Details** — Prefix each rule heading with a two-digit sequence number and use dot-notation for citations.
  * Reason: Minimal addition to the existing XDR template, stable identifiers independent of heading text, and fully compatible with `_core-adr-002-xdr-standards`.
