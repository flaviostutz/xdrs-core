# _core-adr-001: XDR standards

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a consistent way to capture decisions that scales across scopes and subjects, remains easy to navigate, and works well with AI agents.

Decision Records can be of different kinds, depending on the nature of the decision:
- BDR (Business Decision Record): Captures business process, product features, procedures and strategic decisions. Examples: business rules, product policies, customer service, business workflow, control frameworks for regulators for finance, product procedures and manuals, KYC requirements, business requirements in general
- ADR (Architectural Decision Record): Wider architectural and technical decisions. Examples: how big topics relate to each other, system contexts, overview without realy deciding on details, integration patterns, overarching topics, corporate wide practices, corporate systems, external and internal partners etc
- EDR (Engineering Decision Record): captures engineering details about how to implement things. Examples: specific tools and libraries selection, framework usage, best practices on coding, testing, quality, project structure, pipelines etc

Collectively, these are referred to as XDRs.

How should XDRs be structured and organized across types, teams, and scopes?

## Decision Outcome

**Scoped + typed + subject folders**

Provides clear ownership by scope, predictable navigation, and reusable decisions that work well with AI agents by keeping files small and focused.

### Implementation Details

- XDRs MUST contain a clear decision about a certain problem or situation. Avoid being too verbose and focus on explaining clearly the context and the decision. Avoid adding contents that are not original. If you have other references that are important to understand the document, add links and references.
- XDRs are the central artifact of the framework and the authoritative policy for their scope, type, and subject. Supporting artifacts may explain, justify, or operationalize the decision, but they do not replace it.
- XDRs MAY include a `## Metadata` section, but only when at least one supported metadata field is present. When used, `## Metadata` MUST appear immediately before `## Context and Problem Statement`.
- Supported XDR metadata fields are:
  - `Applied to:` Optional. A short description of the contexts in which the decision is applicable. Keep it under 40 words. If omitted, the decision should be interpreted as applying to all logically applicable elements according to the decision text itself. Examples: `Only frontend code`, `JavaScript projects`, `Performance-sensitive codebases`
  - `Validity:` Optional. Defines when the decision is active. Use ISO dates only: `from YYYY-MM-DD`, `until YYYY-MM-DD`, or `from YYYY-MM-DD until YYYY-MM-DD`. If `from` is omitted, the decision takes effect immediately. If `until` is omitted, the decision remains valid indefinitely. `Draft` or `Retired` mean the XDR should be ignored as an active rule or policy.
- Research documents MAY be added under the same subject to capture the exploration, findings, and proposals that backed a decision. Research is useful during elaboration, discussion, approval, retirement, and updates, but the XDR remains the source of truth.
- Make it clear if an instruction is mandatory or advisory
    - Mandatory language: "must", "always", "never", "required", "mandatory"
    - Advisory language: "should", "recommended", "advised", "preferably", "possibly", "optionally"
- Always the following folder structure:
  `.xdrs/[scope]/[type]/[subject]/[number]-[short-title].md`
- Optional supporting artifacts under the same subject:
  - `.xdrs/[scope]/[type]/[subject]/researches/[number]-[short-title].md`
  - `.xdrs/[scope]/[type]/[subject]/skills/[number]-[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
  - `.xdrs/[scope]/[type]/[subject]/articles/[number]-[short-title].md`
- Local images and supporting files referenced by a document SHOULD live in a sibling `assets/` folder next to that document.
  - XDRs in the subject root use `.xdrs/[scope]/[type]/[subject]/assets/`
  - Articles use `.xdrs/[scope]/[type]/[subject]/articles/assets/`
  - Research uses `.xdrs/[scope]/[type]/[subject]/researches/assets/`
  - Skills use `.xdrs/[scope]/[type]/[subject]/skills/[number]-[skill-name]/assets/`
- **Scopes:** 
  - examples: `business-x`, `business-y`, `team-43`, `_core`
  - `_local` is a reserved scope for XDRs created locally to a specific project or repository. XDRs in `_local` must not be shared with or propagated to other contexts. This scope must always be placed in the lowest position in `.xdrs/index.md` so that its decisions override or extend any decisions from all higher-positioned scopes.
  - **Types:** `adrs`, `bdrs`, `edrs`
  - there can exist sufixes to the standard scope names (e.g: `business-x-mobileapp`, `business-y-servicedesk`)
- **Subjects:** MUST be one of the following depending on the type of the XDR:
  - **ADR:** `principles`, `application`, `data`, `integration`, `platform`, `controls`, `operations`
  - **BDR:** `principles`, `marketing`, `product`, `controls`, `operations`, `organization`, `finance`, `sustainability`
  - **EDR:** `principles`, `application`, `infra`, `ai`, `observability`, `devops`, `governance`
- **XDR Id:** [scope]-[type]-[xdr number unique in scope] (the xdr id must be unique among all XDRs of the same type in the different scopes and always use lowercase)
  - Types in IDs: `adr`, `bdr`, `edr`
  - Define the next number of an XDR by checking what is the highest number present in the type+scope. Don't fill numbering gaps, as they might be old deleted XDRs and we should never reuse numbers of different documents/decisions. Numbering gaps are expected.
- Decisions MUST be concise and reference other XDRs to avoid duplication
- The `### Implementation Details` section SHOULD state relevant boundaries or exceptions and what a reader should do or avoid in common cases. Use `## Metadata` for short applicability or lifecycle markers and keep nuanced boundaries in the decision text.
- Use concise rules, examples, or `Do` / `Don't` lists only when they help a reader apply the decision correctly. Keep them short and decision-specific.
- When research exists for a decision, the XDR SHOULD mention the related research documents after the `## Considered Options` list.
- Never use emojis in contents
- Always use file names with lowercase
- Avoid using lengthy instructions on the XDR. If there are long and detailed instructions related to the XDR, or instructions that are outside the decision, create another file with a guide. If the guide is small, keep it in the XDR itself.
- If there is a README.md file in the root of the xdrs folder, always keep it up to date. Never use emojis
- Keep a canonical index with all XDRs of a certain type+scope in `.xdrs/[scope]/[type]/index.md`
  - Organize XDRs by subject for easier navigation
  - Add a list of other scope indexes that this scope might be related to (only add scopes that might be overridden). E.g: "business-x-mobileapp" scope could refer to "business-x" and "sensitive-data" scopes in its index list. XDRs in scopes listed last override XDRs in scopes listed first when addressing the same topic.
  - Document decision conflicts in "Conflicts" section for the XDR that is overriding another XDR in other scopes
  - **Within-scope conflicts:** XDRs within the same type+scope must not conflict. If two XDRs appear to conflict, one should be updated, deprecated, or the conflict resolved through a new XDR.
  - In the index add a short description of what is this scope about (responsibilities, general worries, teams involved, link to discussion process etc)
- Outside the scopes, keep an index pointing to all canonical indexes in `.xdrs/index.md`. Add the text "XDRs in scopes listed last override the ones listed first"
- Always verify if the index is up to date after making changes
- XDRs should be less than 100 lines long as a rule of thumb
  - This is important to make them focused on a clear decision
  - Exceptions can reach 200 lines (templates, more elaborate decision implementations etc)
- ALWAYS use `_local` scope if the user doesn't explicitelly indicate a specific scope while creating an xdr or skill.

**XDR template**

All XDRs MUST follow this template

```markdown
# [scope]-[type]-[number]: [Short Title]

## Metadata

[Optional section. Omit the entire section when neither `Applied to:` nor `Validity:` is defined.]
Applied to: [Optional short applicability scope, under 40 words]
Validity: [Optional. Use `Draft`, `Retired`, `from YYYY-MM-DD`, `until YYYY-MM-DD`, or `from YYYY-MM-DD until YYYY-MM-DD`]

[Very short description of what is the decision, aligned with the titles on the Considered Options section]

[Short description of implementation details for the chosen path]

### Implementation Details

[Optional section with implementation specifics, applicability boundaries, rules, concise examples, or do/don't guidance. This is the answer to the question in the "Context and Problem Statement". (<100 lines)]

## Considered Options

[Optional section present only when there are meaningful options to be discussed.]

* (REJECTED) **Option 1** - Brief description of option 1
  * Reason: Brief description why this was rejected with important aspects to be re-checked in the case we want to change this decision

![Document-local resources layout](assets/document-resource-layout.svg)

**XDR ID Examples:**
- `business-x-adr-001` (not `ADR-business-x-001` or `business-x-adr-1`)
- `business-x-edr-042` (not `EDR-BUSINESS-X-042`)
- `business-x-bdr-007`

## Considered Options

* (REJECTED) **Flat list of decisions** - Simple but becomes unmanageable as the number grows.
  * Reason: Does not scale and makes navigation difficult over time.
* (REJECTED) **Per-team folders without scope** - Easier ownership but loses organization hierarchy.
  * Reason: Lacks a clear hierarchy and makes cross-team reuse harder.
* (CHOSEN) **Scoped + typed + subject folders** - Clear ownership by scope first, then decision type, with predictable navigation and reusable decisions.
  * Reason: Scales well, supports AI agents with focused files, enables reuse across scopes, and groups all decisions for a given scope together regardless of type.
